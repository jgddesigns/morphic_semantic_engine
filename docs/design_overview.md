# Design Overview

The Morphic Semantic Engine (MSE) is built around three ideas:

1. A small, fixed-length numeric state (the seed and its evolution).
2. A deterministic morphing rule that updates the state over time.
3. A semantic mapping layer that turns state-derived codes into tokens.

This creates a lightweight generative engine that can be embedded anywhere.
